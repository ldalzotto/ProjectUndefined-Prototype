# ProjectUndefined-Prototype

This repository is the source code of a proof of concept of a Unity game.

This project contains source code only, there is no asset files. I decided to strip assets from git history as they were taking space for nothing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to share pieces of code that can be inspiring for people who wants to develop similar features.

This project has no external documentation, your guide to understand how things work together will be comments (when there are some ðŸ˜‹). Feel free to dig into code to get a grasp of what is happening.

If you want more details on a specific feature, feel free to post an issue and I will answer to you as best as I can.
